[08.09.2023] Made very basic car rear detection with Haar Cascade classification. The Gaussian Blur functions 
as a Low-Pass Filter, to clear the frame from unnecessary details. Furthermore, the image is dilated (edges 
overexposed) and afterwards, processed by the classifier. The resulting rectangle's position is smoothened 
out via averaging and afterwards displayed on the GUI app.

!! FOR TOMORROW (11.09.2023): Try out different techniques (not necessarily based on Convolutional NNs)
to recognize speed limit signs (maximum and minimum) for (atleast) European roads.

[11.09.2023] Speed Limit (SL) Traffic Sign Recognition (SL-TSR) implemented with image thresholding and Hough transform.
Number recognition on the sign itself still not implemented!

[12.09.2023] SL-TSR improved with colour filtering instead of plain thresholding. The filtering is done in HSV
space instead of RGB (BGR).

[14.09.2023] Implemented disparity map generation with OpenCV Stereo Matcher and additionally implemented a disparity
filter for better results (i.e. a more accurate disparity map, clear of noise)

[15.09.2023] Cleaned up the proof-of-concept code a bit and continued experimentation with disparity
generation for different stereo image/video pairs.

[18.09.2023 - 21.09.2023] Created pseudo distance detection with some made-up camera parameters, paired with
the car detection algorithm from earlier.

[22.09.2023 - 28.09.2023] Made a simplistic car throttle simulation for the PoC PID controller and started implementing the PID-ctrl further.

[03.10.2023] Implemented the digit recognizer and coupled it with the overall detection scheme.

TODO:
    - Merge the car detection algorithm with the TSR. [DONE]
    - Extend the TSR with kNN number recognition for SL detection. [DONE]

BUGS:
    - The TSR sometimes classifies random red dots as SL signs, maybe we have to filter the entire color scheme of the sign??? [FIXED]
    - The digit classifier sometimes wrongly recognizes a contour of a 'third digit' even though there are only
      two digits on the detected sign. Investigate this further!
    - The program crashesh when a frame after the last one is pulled, add a check for this!
